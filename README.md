# Bits of Python

_A micro-series exploring advanced Python concepts one experiment at a time._

This repository contains all experiments, benchmarks, and implementations from my LinkedIn series “Bits of Python”, where I dive into deeper layers of Python which are often overlooked.

Each part explores a single topic in depth with code examples, explanations, and performance comparisons.

The goal: learn something new, implement it properly, and share it clearly.
